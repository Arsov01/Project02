If you want to get the file, you need to follow the following steps:

cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.brainster.co/Aleksandar.Arsov-FE19/project-2-streetartists.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main

The project was quite challenging; I almost gave up and took breaks, and after a lot of effort, I completed the project.
The feeling when your site is difficult and you succeed in creating it is awesome.
